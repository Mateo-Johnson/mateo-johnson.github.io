    "description": "A set of dual-MCU boards, named the EDGE-A and EDGE-B using UART communication between an ESP32-S3 chip and a RP2354B / Kendryte K210 depending on the model. These boards have integrated sensor arrays containing IMUs, Microphones, ToF and dual inbuilt DC motor controllers. These systems saw significant gains when compared to single-MCU microcontrollers. The research paper can be found <a href='https://mateo-johnson.github.io/resources/dualMCUreport.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>. This project will is sponsored by Sipeed and EasyEDA, and will be participating in Buckeye Science & Engineering Fair 2026 and Regeneron Science Talent Search 2025.",

This miniaturized board demonstrates advanced PCB design principles, component selection optimization, and space-efficient layout techniques. The project showcases expertise in high-density circuit design, signal integrity monitoring, and manufacturing constraints for small-form-factor electronics. Features include all essential GPIO breakouts, an integrated IMU, USB-C programming interface, and integrated antenna design within the compact footprint. This board has been used in a small, centimeter accurate room-scale tracking system, in addition to asynchronous environment tracking sensor, spread out over my school's campus.",
